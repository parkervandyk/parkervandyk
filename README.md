## Hi there my name is Parker

I have 6+ years in software engineering working primarily on backend technologies. I mainly work in Node.js with Typescript + Javascript, in the past I've used iPaaS tools like Mulesoft and Boomi. 

I enjoy diving into new technologies and utilizing all of my experience to solve tomorrow's problems today!
